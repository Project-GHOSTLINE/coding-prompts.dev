# Claude Code Sequential Thinking

<TLDRBlock>
Sequential thinking in Claude Code enables step-by-step problem decomposition for complex tasks. The feature processes problems incrementally, allowing verification at each stage. Access it through conversation mode when working on multi-step operations.
</TLDRBlock>

## When This Applies

Use sequential thinking when:

- Debugging complex issues requiring multiple investigative steps
- Implementing features with interdependent components
- Refactoring code with many affected files
- Analyzing system behavior across multiple layers
- Planning changes that require validation before proceeding

## Symptoms You'll See

**When sequential thinking is active:**

Claude Code breaks down problems into discrete steps, completing and verifying each before proceeding. You'll see explicit reasoning about what to do next.

**When sequential thinking is not used:**

Responses may attempt to solve everything at once, potentially missing intermediate verification steps or dependencies between tasks.

## Likely Causes

Sequential thinking is beneficial when:

- The problem has multiple possible approaches requiring evaluation
- Each step's outcome affects subsequent decisions
- Verification is needed before committing to a direction
- The task involves discovery (finding root causes, exploring code)
- Changes in one area may cascade to others

## Fix Sequence

### 1. Identify the Complex Problem

Determine if your task benefits from sequential thinking:

**Verify**: Problem involves multiple steps or requires discovery before solution.

### 2. Request Explicit Step-by-Step Approach

In your conversation with Claude Code, ask for a sequential approach:

**Verify**: Response outlines distinct steps or asks clarifying questions before proceeding.

### 3. Verify Each Step Before Proceeding

After each step completes, check the result:

**Verify**: Output matches expected result before moving to next step.

### 4. Adjust Direction Based on Findings

Use information from completed steps to inform next actions:

**Verify**: Subsequent steps incorporate learnings from previous steps.

### 5. Confirm Final Outcome

After all steps complete, verify the full solution:

**Verify**: Original problem is resolved and all intermediate steps succeeded.

## What NOT to Do

**Don't skip verification between steps**: Each step's output informs the next. Proceeding without verification can compound errors and waste time.

**Don't request everything at once for complex problems**: Asking for a complete solution to a multi-faceted problem may result in incomplete or incorrect approaches. Break it down instead.

**Don't ignore intermediate findings**: If early steps reveal unexpected information, adjust your approach rather than forcing the original plan.

**Don't assume sequential thinking is automatic**: Be explicit about wanting a step-by-step approach, especially for complex or unfamiliar problems.

## Diagnostic Commands

Check current working directory and context:

```bash
pwd
ls -la
```

Verify file state before and after each step:

```bash
git status
git diff
```

Test intermediate results:

```bash
# Run tests after each significant change
npm test
```

Check for errors after each step:

```bash
# Language-specific linting/type checking
npm run lint
```

## FAQ

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "How do I trigger sequential thinking mode?",
    answer: "Sequential thinking isn't a mode you activate. Instead, explicitly request a step-by-step approach in your conversation. Ask Claude Code to break down the problem and verify each step before proceeding."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I use sequential thinking?",
    answer: "Use it for complex problems with multiple steps, debugging that requires investigation, or tasks where each step's outcome affects the next. Simple, well-defined tasks don't require this approach."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I skip steps if I know the answer?",
    answer: "Yes. If you already know certain steps are correct or unnecessary, tell Claude Code to skip them. Sequential thinking is flexible and adapts to your knowledge level."
  },
  {
    question: "Does sequential thinking slow down simple tasks?",
    answer: "It can add overhead for straightforward tasks. Reserve this approach for genuinely complex problems. For simple tasks, direct requests are more efficient."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if sequential thinking helped?",
    answer: "You'll notice fewer false starts, better problem diagnosis, and solutions that account for dependencies between steps. The approach is particularly valuable when initial attempts don't work."
