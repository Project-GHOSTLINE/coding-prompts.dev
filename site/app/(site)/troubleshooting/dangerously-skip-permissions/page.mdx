# Claude Code Dangerously Skip Permissions

<TLDRBlock>
The `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag bypasses Claude Code permission prompts, granting automatic file system access. Use only in trusted, controlled environments like CI/CD pipelines or isolated development containers. The flag removes security safeguards that prevent unauthorized file access.
</TLDRBlock>

## When This Applies

Use this flag when you need Claude Code to run without interactive permission prompts in:

- Automated CI/CD pipelines where no user input is possible
- Docker containers or virtual machines with isolated file systems
- Testing environments where the codebase is fully trusted
- Personal development environments on sandboxed systems

This flag is not appropriate for production systems, shared development machines, or when working with untrusted code.

## Symptoms You'll See

**Without the flag (normal behavior):**

Claude Code prompts for permission before accessing files:
```bash
claude code
# Prompt: "Allow access to /Users/you/project?"
# Requires: Yes/No response
```

**With the flag enabled:**

Claude Code starts without prompts and accesses files automatically:
```bash
claude code --dangerously-skip-permissions
# No prompts - immediate session start
```

## Likely Causes

You need this flag when:

- Running Claude Code in automated scripts or CI/CD where interactive prompts break the workflow
- Operating in headless environments without TTY for user input
- Working in containerized environments where permission prompts are not practical
- Testing or development requires repeated access without manual approval

## Fix Sequence

### 1. Verify Current Permission Behavior

Start Claude Code normally to confirm permission prompts appear:

```bash
claude code
```

**Verify**: Claude Code displays permission prompts before accessing files.

### 2. Navigate to Trusted Directory

Change to the specific project directory where you need automated access:

```bash
cd /path/to/trusted/project
```

**Verify**: Use `pwd` to confirm you are in the correct directory, not a broader scope like your home directory.

### 3. Enable Permission Bypass

Run Claude Code with the flag:

```bash
claude code --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**Verify**: Claude Code starts without displaying permission prompts. Session begins immediately.

### 4. Test File Access

Within the session, request file operations to confirm no prompts appear:

**Verify**: Claude Code reads and writes files without requesting permission for each operation.

### 5. Exit When Complete

Close the session to return to normal permission behavior:

```bash
# Within Claude Code session:
exit
```

**Verify**: Next time you run `claude code` without the flag, permission prompts resume.

## What NOT to Do

**Don't run from your home directory or root**: Running `claude code --dangerously-skip-permissions` from broad directories like `~` or `/` grants access to your entire file system. Always navigate to the specific project directory first.

**Don't use in production environments**: Production systems require audit trails and explicit permission controls. This flag removes those safeguards and creates security vulnerabilities.

**Don't use with untrusted code**: Without permission prompts, Claude Code can read sensitive files (credentials, SSH keys, environment files) or execute commands without your knowledge. Only use this flag when you fully trust the codebase.

**Don't combine with other automation without understanding scope**: Scripting this flag in automation tools multiplies risk if the script runs in unintended directories or contexts.

## Diagnostic Commands

Check if you're in the intended directory before using the flag:

```bash
pwd
```

Verify your current directory is the isolated project, not a broader scope.

Test normal permission behavior (without flag):

```bash
claude code
```

Claude Code should display permission prompts. Use this to confirm normal behavior is restored when the flag is not used.

## FAQ

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "When should I use --dangerously-skip-permissions?",
    answer: "Use this flag only in automated environments like CI/CD pipelines, isolated containers, or trusted development sandboxes where interactive prompts are not possible. Never use in production or with untrusted code."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is the flag named 'dangerously'?",
    answer: "The name explicitly warns that this flag removes important security protections. Without permission checks, Claude Code can access, modify, or delete any file in scope without requesting approval."
  },
  {
    question: "What access does Claude Code gain with this flag?",
    answer: "Claude Code gains automatic read and write access to files in the current directory and subdirectories, ability to execute commands, and access to environment variables - all without prompting for permission."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I disable the permission bypass?",
    answer: "Simply run Claude Code without the flag. Permission checks resume immediately. The flag only affects the specific session where it is used."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I verify the flag is working?",
    answer: "Yes. With the flag enabled, Claude Code starts immediately without permission prompts. Without the flag, Claude Code displays permission prompts before accessing files."
  }
