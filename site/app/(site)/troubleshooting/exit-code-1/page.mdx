# Claude Code Process Exited with Code 1

## Direct Answer

Exit code 1 means Claude Code terminated due to an error. Run `claude code --reset-permissions` then `claude code restart` to fix permission issues, the most common cause. Other causes include corrupted configuration files or network connectivity problems. Follow the fix sequence below to resolve the error.

<QuickAnswer
  solution="claude code --reset-permissions && claude code restart"
  verification="Claude Code should start without errors. Check terminal output for 'Ready' or similar success message."
/>

## When This Applies

You'll need this guide if:
- You see "Process exited with code 1" in your terminal
- Claude Code fails to start or crashes immediately
- You get permission errors when running Claude Code
- Claude Code worked previously but stopped working after system changes
- You recently updated Claude Code or your operating system

## Symptoms You'll See

<TerminalBlock
  title="Error output"
  variant="error"
  content={`# Typical error output
Error: Process exited with code 1

# Or similar variations
Claude Code process terminated unexpectedly
Exit code: 1`}
  copyText={`Error: Process exited with code 1
Claude Code process terminated unexpectedly
Exit code: 1`}
/>

Additional symptoms:
- Terminal shows error and immediately returns to prompt
- No Claude Code interface appears
- Previous session data may be inaccessible
- Config files appear but Claude Code won't launch

## Likely Causes

### Permission Issues

Claude Code can't access required files or directories:
- File permissions changed after installation
- Working directory has restricted access
- Security software blocking file access
- Running from a protected system directory

### Corrupted Configuration

Your `~/.claude/config.json` or related files contain invalid data:
- Manual edits with syntax errors
- Write operation interrupted mid-save
- Conflicting settings from multiple installations
- Cache corruption from improper shutdown

### Network Connectivity

Claude Code can't reach Anthropic's API:
- Firewall blocking outbound connections
- Proxy misconfiguration or credentials expired
- Network connection dropped during initialization
- DNS resolution failures

## Fix Sequence (Recommended Order)

### Fix 1: Reset Permissions

Try this first. Resolves permission-related issues.

```bash
# Check current permission status
claude code --check-permissions
```

**Expected output:**

<TerminalBlock
  title="Permission check output"
  content={`Checking file permissions...
✓ Config directory: accessible
✓ Cache directory: accessible`}
/>

If you see permission errors, reset:

```bash
# Reset all permissions
claude code --reset-permissions

# Restart Claude Code
claude code restart
```

**Verification:**

<TerminalBlock
  title="Successful startup"
  content={`# Try to start Claude Code
claude code

# You should see:
# ✓ Starting Claude Code...
# ✓ Ready`}
  copyText={`claude code`}
/>

**If this worked:** You're done. Claude Code should start normally.
**If it failed:** Proceed to Fix 2.

### Fix 2: Clear Cache and Config

Use this if permission reset didn't work.

```bash
# Step 1: Clear application cache
claude code --clear-cache

# Step 2: Remove config directory (backs up automatically)
rm -rf ~/.claude/cache

# Step 3: Restart
claude code restart
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check if config was recreated
ls -la ~/.claude/

# You should see fresh config files with recent timestamps
```

**If config doesn't exist:**
```bash
# Reconfigure
claude code config set api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

**If this worked:** Claude Code should start with fresh config.
**If it failed:** Proceed to Fix 3.

### Fix 3: Complete Reinstall

Use this only if both previous fixes failed.

```bash
# Step 1: Uninstall completely
npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Step 2: Remove all data
rm -rf ~/.claude

# Step 3: Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Step 4: Reinstall latest version
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Step 5: Verify installation
claude code --version
```

**Expected output:**

<TerminalBlock
  title="Version verification"
  content="claude-code version X.X.X"
/>

**Step 6: Configure**
```bash
claude code config set api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude code

# Should see successful startup without exit code 1
```

## Anti-patterns (Things That Make It Worse)

**Don't do these:**

- ❌ **Running with `sudo` to "fix" permissions** — This creates permission conflicts and makes the problem worse
- ❌ **Manually editing `~/.claude/config.json` while troubleshooting** — Introduces new syntax errors
- ❌ **Installing multiple versions simultaneously** — Causes path conflicts and unpredictable behavior
- ❌ **Interrupting Claude Code mid-operation** — Corrupts state files and cache
- ❌ **Ignoring specific error messages** — Exit code 1 is generic; actual cause may be in earlier output
- ❌ **Skipping verification steps** — You won't know which fix worked or if the problem is actually resolved

**Instead do:**

- ✅ Use `--reset-permissions` instead of `sudo`
- ✅ Use `claude code config` commands instead of manual edits
- ✅ Uninstall old versions before installing new ones
- ✅ Let operations complete fully before canceling
- ✅ Read full terminal output, not just the exit code
- ✅ Verify each fix with the commands provided

## If It Still Fails: Collect Diagnostics

If all three fixes fail, gather this information before contacting support:

```bash
# 1. Get Claude Code version
claude code --version > ~/claude-debug.txt

# 2. Check Node.js version
node --version >> ~/claude-debug.txt

# 3. Check npm version
npm --version >> ~/claude-debug.txt

# 4. List global npm packages
npm list -g --depth=0 >> ~/claude-debug.txt

# 5. Check permissions on Claude directory
ls -la ~/.claude >> ~/claude-debug.txt

# 6. Run Claude Code with verbose logging
claude code --verbose 2>&1 | tee -a ~/claude-debug.txt
```

**What to include when asking for help:**
- Contents of `~/claude-debug.txt`
- Full terminal output showing the exit code 1 error
- Operating system and version (run `uname -a` on Unix, `ver` on Windows)
- What you were doing when the error first appeared
- Which fixes you tried and their exact results

**Where to get help:**
- [Anthropic Claude Code Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code)
- Anthropic support (if error persists after all fixes)

## FAQ

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "What does exit code 1 mean in Claude Code?",
    answer: "Exit code 1 is a Unix-standard general error signal. It means Claude Code encountered a problem and had to terminate. The code '1' indicates 'something went wrong' but doesn't specify what. Check the terminal output above the exit code for the actual cause."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does Claude Code keep exiting with code 1?",
    answer: "Persistent exit code 1 errors indicate corrupted configuration files, insufficient system resources, conflicting dependencies, or outdated Claude Code versions. Try the reset-permissions command first, then clear cache, and finally reinstall if needed."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I prevent exit code 1 errors?",
    answer: "Keep Claude Code updated regularly, check permissions periodically with --check-permissions, maintain stable network connection, and backup your config file before making changes. Avoid manually editing configuration files or interrupting Claude Code during operations."
  },
  {
    question: "Does exit code 1 affect my project files?",
    answer: "No. Exit code 1 only affects Claude Code's ability to run. Your project files, code, and data remain completely safe and unchanged. The error is about Claude Code itself, not your work."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I contact support for exit code 1?",
    answer: "Try all three fixes above first. If the error persists after a complete reinstall, or if you see additional error messages beyond just 'exit code 1', then contact Anthropic support with the diagnostic information from the 'If It Still Fails' section."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Claude Code while fixing this error?",
    answer: "No. Exit code 1 means Claude Code has stopped completely. You must fix the error before you can use Claude Code again. However, the fixes are typically quick to apply."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I see a different exit code?",
    answer: "Different exit codes indicate different errors. Exit code 127 means command not found. Exit code 130 means interrupted by user. Exit code 1 is generic. Check the actual error message in terminal output for the real cause."
  }
