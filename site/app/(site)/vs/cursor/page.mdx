# Claude Code vs Cursor

<TLDRBlock>
Claude Code and Cursor are both AI coding assistants with different approaches. Claude Code operates as a command-line tool with terminal integration, while Cursor is a VS Code fork with built-in AI features. Each suits different workflows and preferences.
</TLDRBlock>

## When This Applies

Compare these tools when:

- Choosing an AI coding assistant for your workflow
- Evaluating terminal-based vs IDE-integrated tools
- Deciding between command-line and graphical interfaces
- Assessing which tool fits your development environment

## Symptoms You'll See

**Claude Code characteristics:**

- Command-line interface accessed via terminal
- Works with any text editor
- Requires terminal comfort
- Configuration through CLI commands and config files

**Cursor characteristics:**

- Full IDE with integrated AI features
- Built on VS Code architecture
- GUI-based interaction
- Extension ecosystem from VS Code

## Likely Causes

You're comparing these tools because:

- You need AI assistance but aren't sure which tool fits your workflow
- Your team uses different development environments
- You're evaluating costs and capabilities
- You want terminal-based vs IDE-integrated options

## Fix Sequence

### 1. Identify Your Workflow Requirements

Determine your development environment and preferences:

**Verify**: You know whether you prefer terminal-based or IDE-based tools.

### 2. Test Claude Code Installation

If considering Claude Code, verify it works in your environment:

```bash
claude code --version
```

**Verify**: Command returns version information.

### 3. Evaluate Editor Integration Needs

Determine if you need specific editor features:

**Verify**: You've identified must-have editor features or extensions.

### 4. Test Basic Operations

Try common tasks in your preferred tool:

**Verify**: Tool handles your typical development workflows.

### 5. Assess Long-term Fit

Consider which tool aligns with your development style:

**Verify**: Tool integrates smoothly with your existing workflow.

## What NOT to Do

**Don't choose based solely on popularity**: Select the tool that fits your workflow. Terminal users may prefer Claude Code; IDE users may prefer Cursor.

**Don't assume you need to switch editors**: Claude Code works with your existing editor. Cursor requires adopting a new IDE.

**Don't expect identical capabilities**: These are different tools with different architectures. Each has strengths in its domain.

**Don't ignore your team's workflow**: If your team uses specific editors or terminals, choose tools that integrate with existing setups.

## Diagnostic Commands

Check Claude Code availability:

```bash
which claude
claude code --version
```

Check current editor:

```bash
echo $EDITOR
```

View Claude Code configuration:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/config.json
```
